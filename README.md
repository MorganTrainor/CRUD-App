we were tasked to build an android application for admins and employees to perform CRUD operations on employees, i have managed this in what I feel is a sleek, easy
to use app that provides some extra functionality.

The app can be run in Android Studio  
The login for the app is "admin" and "admin/ or "employee" and "employee"
